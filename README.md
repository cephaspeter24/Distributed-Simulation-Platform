# Clarity: Distributed Simulation Platform

## Overview
Clarity is a distributed platform for managing complex simulation states and parallel scenario execution. It provides a robust framework for creating, managing, and analyzing multiple simulation instances while maintaining system integrity and consistent state management.

## Core Components

### State Management Contract
- Handles distributed state synchronization across nodes
- Manages atomic state transitions and validation
- Provides rollback capabilities for failed state changes
- Implements conflict resolution for concurrent modifications

### Consistency Engine Contract
- Ensures simulation state remains coherent across all nodes
- Validates state transitions against defined system rules
- Maintains referential integrity across connected components
- Provides automated detection of invalid state combinations

### Parallel Execution Contract
- Orchestrates multiple simultaneous simulation instances
- Manages branching and merging of simulation states
- Tracks divergence points and enables state comparison
- Provides isolation between parallel execution paths

### Governance Contract
- Enforces access control and permission management
- Implements audit logging for all system operations
- Ensures compliance with defined simulation parameters
- Manages resource allocation and usage limits

## Technical Requirements
- Node.js 18.0+
- Ethereum-compatible blockchain network
- IPFS for distributed storage
- Web3.js or Ethers.js library

## Installation
```bash
npm install @clarity/core
npm install @clarity/contracts
```

## Quick Start
1. Initialize the core system:
```javascript
const Clarity = require('@clarity/core');
const system = new Clarity.System({
  provider: 'YOUR_PROVIDER_URL',
  governance: 'GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'
});
```

2. Deploy necessary contracts:
```javascript
await system.deployContracts({
  stateManager: true,
  consistencyEngine: true,
  parallelExecutor: true
});
```

3. Start a new simulation instance:
```javascript
const instance = await system.createInstance({
  parameters: YOUR_SIMULATION_PARAMS,
  constraints: YOUR_CONSTRAINT_SET
});
```

## Security Considerations
- All state transitions are cryptographically signed
- Node validation prevents invalid state propagation
- Automatic detection of malicious state manipulation attempts
- Built-in circuit breakers for unexpected behavior
